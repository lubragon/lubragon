## 👍🏽 About me:



🌱  I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Information Systems at Universidade Vila Velha.

📗 Throughout my studies, I've been focused on developing my skills in a range of areas, including SQL, Python, Logic, Java and Web Development.

⭐ I'm particularly interested in exploring areas like data analysis and software development, and I'm excited to see where my studies and experiences will take me in the years to come.

💡 I'm actively seeking out opportunities to put my theoretical knowledge into practice by working on real-world projects. I'm also on the lookout for a challenging and collaborative professional environment where I can continue to learn and grow. If you're interested in learning more about my skills and experiences, please feel free to explore my Github repositories and get in touch!
